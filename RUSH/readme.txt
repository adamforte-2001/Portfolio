This is a simple that demonstrates some system calls including but not limited to fork, dup2, and execv.
These system calls are used to create new processes the user can run inside the shell.
This shell also supports the output redirection operator '>'

For example, this command will write text to a new file called new.txt:
echo "this is some text" > new.txt.
